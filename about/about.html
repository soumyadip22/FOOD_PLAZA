        <h3 class="s">Our Heritage</h3>
        <p class="m">Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first food plaza opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.
            Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Starbucks offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.
            
            In 1981, Howard Schultz ( chairman, president and chief executive officer) first walked into a Starbucks store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into food plaza and joined a year later.
            
            A year later, in 1983, Howard travelled to Italy and became captivated by Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and home. He leftfood plaza  for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 to purchase Starbucks with the help of local investors.
            
            From the beginning, food plaza set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.
            
            Our mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighbourhood at a time.
            
            Today, with store in more than 75 markets, food plaza is the premier roaster and retailer of speciality coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to bring both our heritage and an exceptional experience to life.</p>
    <h3 class="s">Our Company</h3>
    <p class="m">To say food plaza purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffees is very true. That’s the essence of what we do – but it hardly tells the whole story.
        Our coffeehouses have become a beacon for coffee lovers everywhere. Why do they insist on food plaza? Because they know they can count on genuine service, an inviting atmosphere and a superb cup of expertly roasted and richly brewed coffee every time.
